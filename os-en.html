						<h1 class="timeline-hero__title" id="timeline-title">From batch monitors to pocket OSes, how teams kept people and hardware in sync</h1>
						<p class="timeline-hero__lede">
							In the 1950s a GM night operator sighed, “I spend more time swapping tapes than running jobs.” GM-NAA I/O and FMS started stitching work together so the mainframe never slept, while SHARE members pleaded, “Let’s all follow the same playbook.” Soon NASA labs and universities were slicing time so several people could chat with one computer at once.
						</p>
						<p class="timeline-hero__lede">
							System/360 promised, “Different hardware, same OS,” and Bell Labs’ UNIX spread the habit of piping tiny tools together. The 1980s and 1990s brought MS-DOS, Macintosh, and Windows 95 into living rooms, while the Linux community proved a global mailing list could evolve a kernel. In the 2000s and beyond, Mac OS X, iPhone OS, and Android reshaped mobile life, Docker and Kubernetes organized the cloud, and custom silicon now asks operating systems to keep experiences identical wherever code runs.
						</p>
						<p class="timeline-hero__lede">
							Pick a year to see the problem those teams faced, the principle they leaned on, and where that idea pops up today. No prior OS theory needed—we stay with the people, the worry they had, and the habit we still practice.

						<p>Linus Torvalds shared an early kernel on comp.os.minix and asked for help. People replied with disk drivers, schedulers, and filesystems, while GNU tools filled in the user space. Almost overnight it grew into a complete UNIX-like stack.</p>
						<p>The GPL license required improvements to stay open, so every patch benefited the next person. Linux moved from hobby PCs to servers, routers, and phones, proving a worldwide mailing list could maintain a production kernel.</p>

						<p>The GPL kept code open and nudged contributors toward modular patches. Modern infrastructure projects—from Kubernetes to router firmware—still rely on that distributed workflow.</p>
