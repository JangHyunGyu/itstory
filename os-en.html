						<h1 class="timeline-hero__title" id="timeline-title">From batch monitors to pocket OSes, how teams kept people and hardware in sync</h1>
						<p class="timeline-hero__lede">
							In Manchester a night-shift engineer leaned over the Baby test machine and wondered, “Will a handful of bootstrap lines really be enough?” Across the ocean GM’s graveyard crew sighed, “We spend more time swapping tapes than running jobs,” while NASA labs tried to slice time so students could share one mainframe without fighting over the console.
						</p>
						<p class="timeline-hero__lede">
							IBM answered with System/360 and its promise, “Different models, same OS,” and Bell Labs’ UNIX crew countered with, “Just string small tools together.” MS-DOS, the Macintosh, and Windows 95 pulled the desktop into homes and offices, the Linux community proved strangers on a mailing list could co-own a kernel, and later Mac OS X, iPhone OS, Android, Docker, and Kubernetes stretched the idea of an operating system from pockets to whole clouds.
						</p>
						<p class="timeline-hero__lede">
							Scroll through the years to hear what each team worried about, how they answered it, and which habits survived. No jargon exam awaits—each modal keeps the focus on people, the problem on their mind, and the lesson that stayed behind.
