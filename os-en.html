						<h1 class="timeline-hero__title" id="timeline-title">From batch monitors to pocket OSes, how teams kept people and hardware in sync</h1>
						<p class="timeline-hero__lede">
							In the 1950s a GM night operator sighed, “I spend more time swapping tapes than running jobs.” GM-NAA I/O and FMS started stitching work together so the mainframe never slept, while SHARE members pleaded, “Let’s all follow the same playbook.” Soon NASA labs and universities were slicing time so several people could chat with one computer at once.
						</p>
						<p class="timeline-hero__lede">
							System/360 promised, “Different hardware, same OS,” and Bell Labs’ UNIX spread the habit of piping tiny tools together. The 1980s and 1990s brought MS-DOS, Macintosh, and Windows 95 into living rooms, while the Linux community proved a global mailing list could evolve a kernel. In the 2000s and beyond, Mac OS X, iPhone OS, and Android reshaped mobile life, Docker and Kubernetes organized the cloud, and custom silicon now asks operating systems to keep experiences identical wherever code runs.
						</p>
						<p class="timeline-hero__lede">
							Pick a year to see the problem those teams faced, the principle they leaned on, and where that idea pops up today. No prior OS theory needed—we stay with the people, the worry they had, and the habit we still practice.

					<p class="event-detail__summary">A GM night operator groaned, “I swap tapes more than I run jobs,” so GM-NAA I/O queued work automatically and kept the 704 busy till morning.</p>
				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Imagine paying a whole crew to stand in front of a room-sized computer, swapping tapes and hitting “start” every few minutes. Every pause burned money because the mainframe sat idle. GM and IBM wrote a short control program that played the role of a traffic clerk, feeding jobs to the machine one after another.</p>
						<p>The monitor read a punch-card recipe for each job—what tape to mount, what program to load, where to store the results—and carried it out automatically. Overnight batches suddenly ran back-to-back with no one standing guard, proving that a thin layer of software could keep very expensive hardware productive.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>GM-NAA I/O popularized the idea of a job control language: a mini instruction sheet that tells the OS which program to run and which devices to use. That concept lives on in modern batch schedulers, continuous-integration pipelines, and any workflow system that queues tasks for a shared machine.</p>

				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Customers in the SHARE user group swapped homemade macros that told the mainframe how to compile and run a FORTRAN program. Every lab wanted the same reliable buttons, so IBM bundled those best practices into a single Fortran Monitor System.</p>
						<p>Scientists now dropped their card deck in a reader, and FMS automatically chose the right compiler, grabbed scratch tapes, and wrote a tidy report. It was the difference between every lab inventing its own remote control and the vendor shipping one remote that simply worked.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>FMS proved that device-independent I/O mattered: programs described what kind of input or output they needed, and the OS figured out which tape drive or printer fit.

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Before OS/360, buying a faster mainframe felt like buying a new language—you rewrote programs, retrained staff, and hoped the peripherals matched. IBM promised something radical: one compatible family of machines and one OS that could drive them all.</p>
						<p>Customers recompiled their code and ran it on bigger or smaller models without rewriting their logic. Under the hood IBM standardized how memory was mapped, how devices announced themselves, and how programs asked for services. It was the moment the OS became a long-term contract between hardware makers and software teams.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>OS/360 cemented the idea of a stable systems programming interface (SPI): a promise that as long as you call documented services, the vendor will keep your software running. Today’s POSIX standards, cloud instance families, and long-term support releases follow that same compatibility contract.</p>

						<p>Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie stripped away complexity until they had a small kernel, a filesystem that treated “everything as a file,” and a new C language that made the code easier to tweak. Instead of a huge monolith, UNIX shipped as many tiny commands that you could snap together like LEGO bricks.</p>
						<p>AT&T licensed the source cheaply to universities, so students learned by modifying the real kernel. That openness spread a culture where you pipe the output of one program into another and expect the OS to manage processes safely in the background.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>UNIX demonstrated that portability (writing most of the OS in a high-level language), multitasking, and modular utilities could coexist. Modern shells, POSIX APIs, and even container images rely on those same principles of “small tools that do one thing well.”</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Early personal computers all used different disk controllers. Gary Kildall’s CP/M hid those differences behind two layers: BDOS handled files, and a tiny BIOS slice talked to the hardware. Port the BIOS and the rest of the OS—and every application—just worked.</p>
						<p>Software makers could now sell one word processor or spreadsheet to dozens of machine brands. Offices noticed that the same floppy disk ran at home and at work, making the microcomputer feel dependable instead of experimental.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>CP/M’s split between BDOS (general services) and BIOS (hardware-specific code) is the direct ancestor of today’s driver model. Modern operating systems still keep portable logic in the kernel and isolate device quirks inside replaceable drivers.</p>

						<p>DEC’s VAX hardware paired with the VMS operating system brought big-iron tricks to smaller budgets.

						<p>Apple published Human Interface Guidelines so third-party apps reused the same scroll bars, alerts, and menu shortcuts. The OS was no longer just disk drivers—it became the user’s language for pointing, clicking, and expecting the system to respond instantly.</p>

					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>System 1’s QuickDraw graphics and Resource Manager taught developers to let the OS handle fonts, icons, and input events. Modern UI frameworks—from Windows to iOS—still use that event-driven loop where the OS delivers clicks and redraw requests to each app.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Linus Torvalds announced “just a hobby” kernel on the comp.os.minix forum, inviting others to test it. Volunteers around the world added disk drivers, schedulers, and filesystems, while the GNU project supplied compilers and user tools. The pieces clicked together into a full UNIX-like system.</p>
						<p>Because the source code was public and the GPL license required sharing improvements, Linux improved faster with every contributor. It moved from dorm rooms to servers, routers, and eventually Android phones, showing that a community could maintain a production-quality kernel.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>The GPL license forced changes to stay open, encouraging modular design so patches could mix and match. Modern open infrastructure—from Kubernetes to the drivers in your router—depends on that distributed development model pioneered by Linux.</p>

						<p>Windows 95 greeted users with the Start button and taskbar, making it obvious how to launch programs, switch tasks, and shut down. Plug and Play detected new hardware and installed drivers automatically, so adding a modem or sound card no longer felt like surgery.</p>
						<p>Underneath, the 32-bit Win32 API gave developers a modern foundation while still loading older DOS apps. The OS brought built-in networking and a user-friendly shell just as the web arrived, locking the PC into workplaces and homes.</p>

						<p>When Apple released Mac OS X, the Aqua interface with bounce animations sat on top of Darwin, a core based on NeXTSTEP and BSD UNIX. Designers saw a beautiful desktop, while engineers opened the Terminal app and found the same POSIX commands they used on servers.</p>

					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Android 1.0 used the Linux kernel for low-level tasks, but wrapped it with a Java-based toolkit, touchscreen home screen, and an early Play Store. Developers downloaded the SDK, tested apps in an emulator, and used “intents” to let apps share actions like opening a map or sending a photo.</p>
						<p>Because Android was open source, handset makers and carriers could customize the interface yet keep the same core. It proved that Linux could shrink down to a phone and still manage power, radio chips, and secure app sandboxes for millions of users.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>Android made sandboxing and permissions mainstream for mobile: each app runs as its own Linux user and must request access to sensors or contacts. That security model spread to other mobile platforms and even desktop app stores.</p>

						<p>Docker wrapped complex Linux features—namespaces for isolation and cgroups for resource limits—behind simple commands like <code>docker build</code> and <code>docker run</code>. Developers could snapshot their app and its dependencies into an image and expect it to behave the same on laptops, servers, or the cloud.</p>
						<p>Operations teams loved the repeatability: if the container ran during testing, it would run in production. This turned the OS into a lightweight substrate that simply launches containers, while the image carries the rest of the environment.</p>

						<p>Docker popularized layered filesystems (images share common base layers), hosted registries for sharing those images, and a DevOps workflow where the OS focuses on isolation instead of library management. Modern serverless platforms and CI/CD pipelines borrow heavily from this model.</p>

						<p>Kubernetes introduced the idea of declaring the “desired state” for your apps in YAML: how many copies to run, which ports to open, and how to update.
