					<p class="event-detail__summary">General Motors engineers scripted job control for IBM’s 704 so production runs no longer stalled between programs.</p>
				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Imagine paying a whole crew to stand in front of a room-sized computer, swapping tapes and hitting “start” every few minutes. Every pause burned money because the mainframe sat idle. GM and IBM wrote a short control program that played the role of a traffic clerk, feeding jobs to the machine one after another.</p>
						<p>The monitor read a punch-card recipe for each job—what tape to mount, what program to load, where to store the results—and carried it out automatically. Overnight batches suddenly ran back-to-back with no one standing guard, proving that a thin layer of software could keep very expensive hardware productive.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>GM-NAA I/O popularized the idea of a job control language: a mini instruction sheet that tells the OS which program to run and which devices to use. That concept lives on in modern batch schedulers, continuous-integration pipelines, and any workflow system that queues tasks for a shared machine.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Customers in the SHARE user group swapped homemade macros that told the mainframe how to compile and run a FORTRAN program. Every lab wanted the same reliable buttons, so IBM bundled those best practices into a single Fortran Monitor System.</p>
						<p>Scientists now dropped their card deck in a reader, and FMS automatically chose the right compiler, grabbed scratch tapes, and wrote a tidy report. It was the difference between every lab inventing its own remote control and the vendor shipping one remote that simply worked.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>FMS proved that device-independent I/O mattered: programs described what kind of input or output they needed, and the OS figured out which tape drive or printer fit. That abstraction is the same trick modern drivers and cloud services use when you print a document or mount shared storage.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Before OS/360, buying a faster mainframe felt like buying a new language—you rewrote programs, retrained staff, and hoped the peripherals matched. IBM promised something radical: one compatible family of machines and one OS that could drive them all.</p>
						<p>Customers recompiled their code and ran it on bigger or smaller models without rewriting their logic. Under the hood IBM standardized how memory was mapped, how devices announced themselves, and how programs asked for services. It was the moment the OS became a long-term contract between hardware makers and software teams.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>OS/360 cemented the idea of a stable systems programming interface (SPI): a promise that as long as you call documented services, the vendor will keep your software running. Today’s POSIX standards, cloud instance families, and long-term support releases follow that same compatibility contract.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie stripped away complexity until they had a small kernel, a filesystem that treated “everything as a file,” and a new C language that made the code easier to tweak. Instead of a huge monolith, UNIX shipped as many tiny commands that you could snap together like LEGO bricks.</p>
						<p>AT&T licensed the source cheaply to universities, so students learned by modifying the real kernel. That openness spread a culture where you pipe the output of one program into another and expect the OS to manage processes safely in the background.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>UNIX demonstrated that portability (writing most of the OS in a high-level language), multitasking, and modular utilities could coexist. Modern shells, POSIX APIs, and even container images rely on those same principles of “small tools that do one thing well.”</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Early personal computers all used different disk controllers. Gary Kildall’s CP/M hid those differences behind two layers: BDOS handled files, and a tiny BIOS slice talked to the hardware. Port the BIOS and the rest of the OS—and every application—just worked.</p>
						<p>Software makers could now sell one word processor or spreadsheet to dozens of machine brands. Offices noticed that the same floppy disk ran at home and at work, making the microcomputer feel dependable instead of experimental.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>CP/M’s split between BDOS (general services) and BIOS (hardware-specific code) is the direct ancestor of today’s driver model. Modern operating systems still keep portable logic in the kernel and isolate device quirks inside replaceable drivers.</p>

				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>DEC’s VAX hardware paired with the VMS operating system brought big-iron tricks to smaller budgets. Virtual memory let engineers run programs larger than physical RAM by swapping pieces to disk, while clustering joined multiple VAX machines so one failure did not stop the whole service.</p>

						<p>IBM needed an operating system in under a year. Microsoft bought QDOS, renamed it MS-DOS, and polished the commands so any compatible BIOS could load programs, read disks, and talk to printers in the same way.</p>
						<p>Because the interface was consistent, software makers could target “PC-DOS/MS-DOS” and trust it would run on clones. That simple command line—with commands like <code>DIR</code> and <code>COPY</code>—taught millions how an OS mediates between user commands and hardware.</p>

						<p>The original Macintosh bundled System 1, a graphical interface with folders, a trash can, and pull-down menus. Instead of typing commands, people could drag a file onto a printer icon and watch a queue animation finish the job.</p>
						<p>Apple published Human Interface Guidelines so third-party apps reused the same scroll bars, alerts, and menu shortcuts. The OS was no longer just disk drivers—it became the user’s language for pointing, clicking, and expecting the system to respond instantly.</p>

					<p class="event-detail__summary">Linus Torvalds published a hobby UNIX clone under a copyleft license, igniting a global collaboration.</p>
				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Linus Torvalds announced “just a hobby” kernel on the comp.os.minix forum, inviting others to test it. Volunteers around the world added disk drivers, schedulers, and filesystems, while the GNU project supplied compilers and user tools. The pieces clicked together into a full UNIX-like system.</p>
						<p>Because the source code was public and the GPL license required sharing improvements, Linux improved faster with every contributor. It moved from dorm rooms to servers, routers, and eventually Android phones, showing that a community could maintain a production-quality kernel.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>The GPL license forced changes to stay open, encouraging modular design so patches could mix and match. Modern open infrastructure—from Kubernetes to the drivers in your router—depends on that distributed development model pioneered by Linux.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Windows 95 greeted users with the Start button and taskbar, making it obvious how to launch programs, switch tasks, and shut down. Plug and Play detected new hardware and installed drivers automatically, so adding a modem or sound card no longer felt like surgery.</p>
						<p>Underneath, the 32-bit Win32 API gave developers a modern foundation while still loading older DOS apps. The OS brought built-in networking and a user-friendly shell just as the web arrived, locking the PC into workplaces and homes.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>Windows 95 standardized the driver model and introduced setup wizards that walked users through complex tasks. Those patterns—Start menu, system tray, plug-and-play notifications—remain staples of desktop operating systems today.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>When Apple released Mac OS X, the Aqua interface with bounce animations sat on top of Darwin, a core based on NeXTSTEP and BSD UNIX. Designers saw a beautiful desktop, while engineers opened the Terminal app and found the same POSIX commands they used on servers.</p>
						<p>Carbon allowed classic Mac apps to move over gradually, and Cocoa encouraged new Objective-C apps with consistent panels and menus. The OS proved you could have a consumer-friendly shell with a rock-solid UNIX heart.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>Mac OS X normalized a dual personality: GUI on the surface, UNIX underneath. That model paved the way for modern developer workflows involving package managers, scripting, and cross-platform toolchains that expect a POSIX-compatible environment.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Android 1.0 used the Linux kernel for low-level tasks, but wrapped it with a Java-based toolkit, touchscreen home screen, and an early Play Store. Developers downloaded the SDK, tested apps in an emulator, and used “intents” to let apps share actions like opening a map or sending a photo.</p>
						<p>Because Android was open source, handset makers and carriers could customize the interface yet keep the same core. It proved that Linux could shrink down to a phone and still manage power, radio chips, and secure app sandboxes for millions of users.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>Android made sandboxing and permissions mainstream for mobile: each app runs as its own Linux user and must request access to sensors or contacts. That security model spread to other mobile platforms and even desktop app stores.</p>

					<p class="event-detail__summary">dotCloud open-sourced Docker, pairing Linux namespaces with an easy CLI so teams could package apps once and run anywhere.</p>
				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Docker wrapped complex Linux features—namespaces for isolation and cgroups for resource limits—behind simple commands like <code>docker build</code> and <code>docker run</code>. Developers could snapshot their app and its dependencies into an image and expect it to behave the same on laptops, servers, or the cloud.</p>
						<p>Operations teams loved the repeatability: if the container ran during testing, it would run in production. This turned the OS into a lightweight substrate that simply launches containers, while the image carries the rest of the environment.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>Docker popularized layered filesystems (images share common base layers), hosted registries for sharing those images, and a DevOps workflow where the OS focuses on isolation instead of library management. Modern serverless platforms and CI/CD pipelines borrow heavily from this model.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Kubernetes introduced the idea of declaring the “desired state” for your apps in YAML: how many copies to run, which ports to open, and how to update. Controllers inside the cluster compared that wish list to reality and kept adjusting—adding pods, restarting failing ones—until the two matched.</p>
						<p>Developers stopped thinking about individual servers and instead targeted the Kubernetes API. Cloud providers turned it into a managed service, blurring the line between operating system and cloud control plane.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>Kubernetes formalized the reconciliation loop (watch current state, compare to desired, make fixes) and built-in service discovery. Those patterns now show up in infrastructure-as-code tools and managed platforms that treat clusters like one programmable computer.</p>
