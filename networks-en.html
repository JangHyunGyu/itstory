			</header>
			<section class="event-detail__body">
				<div class="event-detail__story">
					<p>During a stormy night the station was silent except for dripping roofs. Engineer Mary joined thin wires to an unfamiliar box while the apprentice waited at the platform’s end. When Mary completed the circuit the brass needle twitched, and the apprentice shouted, “It moved!” George wrote the arrival time in his ledger—accurate for the first time—and whispered that passengers would no longer wait in the dark.</p>
					<p>Within a week nearby stations borrowed the idea. Engineers sketched wiring routes on maps and tested magnets until they could reproduce the exact tilt of each needle at the far end. The small panel became a reliable language between stations.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="event-detail__notes">
					<p>Rail traffic grew faster than human messengers could ride. The needle telegraph used electromagnetic coils to pull a compass-like pointer, letting staff see distant signals instantly. Standardized positions meant any operator could read the message, reducing collisions and introducing the habit of time-stamped train logs.</p>

					<p>The pair hauled portable telegraph gear by carriage, visiting operators from Baltimore to New York. Each time they asked, “How long is your short mark?” and scribbled the timing in their journals. After dozens of interviews they compiled a tidy table of letters mapped to lengths of pulses. The night they finished, they celebrated quietly—then printed copies for every office.</p>
					<p>Operators placed the booklet beside their keys. When confusion arose the supervisor would tap the cover and remind staff, “Follow the book.” Misread messages plummeted, and the once-local rhythm became a national standard.</p>
