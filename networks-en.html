					<p>Data center teams rewired halls into leaf-spine fabrics and tested shiny new optics late into the night. When dashboards showed traffic flowing cleanly, they celebrated with pizza on the colocation floor.</p>
					<p>Enterprises soon copied the design so virtualization, analytics, and video meetings would not saturate the core. 40G/100G became the new normal for cloud backbones.</p>
