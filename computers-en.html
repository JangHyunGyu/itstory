					<h2 id="event-1822-difference-title">Difference Engine Plans · Charles Babbage</h2>
					<p class="event-detail__summary">"What if a machine printed the tables for us without mistakes?" Babbage wondered while sketching brass gears long after midnight.</p>
				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>While revising astronomical tables for the Royal Astronomical Society, Babbage slammed his notebook shut and groaned, "If a machine turned the cranks for us, the errors would vanish." He rushed back to the workshops with sketches of interlocking gears, and apprentices poked at the drawings asking, "Can we really cut teeth this tiny?" Babbage laid out brass samples on the bench and coached them through each locking mechanism.</p>
						<p>Months later at a Royal Society exhibition an astronomer squinted at the whirring prototype and asked, "Does this mean no more midnight corrections?" Babbage spun the handle and replied, "Pull the lever and the next column prints itself." An engineer beside him whispered, "I need this in my factory ledger," carrying the idea onward even before the full engine was complete.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>The Difference Engine applied a mathematical insight: polynomials can be evaluated with addition alone when broken into finite differences. Inputs became the positions of metal rods, and outputs appeared on numbered wheels. Technology of the time could not produce a full-scale machine, yet the notion of delegating repetitive calculations heavily influenced later computer designs.</p>

					<p class="event-detail__summary">"Change the card, change the music," Lovelace told a friend, turning her translation notes into a conversation about programming.</p>
				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>While translating Luigi Menabrea’s lecture, Lovelace pushed her chair back and exclaimed, "If the cards hold different symbols, the engine could compose music!" Her colleague gasped, "You mean it could play more than numbers?" She spent the evening drawing tables that spelled out loops and branches so anyone could follow the logic.</p>
						<p>When Babbage read the manuscript he wrote back, "You have charted possibilities I never described." Over tea, Lovelace laughed with friends about teaching a machine to waltz, and the London math circle passed the notes around whispering, "So instructions alone could change what it creates."</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>In Lovelace’s description, punch cards encoded commands, and the engine separated storage from computation units. Today we recognize that structure as the basis for modern programs. Her observation that the machine might operate on symbols beyond numbers opened the door to viewing computing as a general-purpose medium.</p>

					<p class="event-detail__summary">"Suppose a machine copied each pencil stroke we make," Turing mused at the chalkboard, sketching the model that defines computability.</p>
				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>His advisor tapped the chalkboard and asked, "How do we describe a procedure precisely?" Turing replied, "Imagine a strip of paper and a head that reads and writes symbols as we instruct it." Late that night he drafted a table of state transitions, muttering, "Each move follows from the last; no human intervention needed."</p>
						<p>At the seminar Alonzo Church leaned forward and asked, "Can this model tell us what problems are impossible?" Turing smiled. "Yes, it even shows a program might never halt." Students scribbled furiously, realizing this invisible machine marked the boundary between solvable and impossible tasks.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>The Turing Machine separates instructions, states, and inputs in a way that mirrors modern computers. By consuming symbols one at a time, it became the standard language for discussing algorithms, and it remains a fundamental tool for exploring theoretical boundaries.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>During a harsh Iowa winter, Atanasoff wrapped his hands around a coffee mug and groaned, "They're falling asleep over these matrices." Berry leaned across the table: "Then let's make a drum store the numbers for them." Back in the lab they bolted capacitors onto a spinning cylinder, and Berry joked while soldering, "Soon you'll press a button and take a nap."</p>
						<p>On demo day the faculty crowded around as punch cards spilled out 29 simultaneous solutions. "No student touched these rows?" one professor asked. Atanasoff waved the card stack and answered, "The drum kept every bit." A graduate student lingered to copy the schematics, already plotting the next experiment.</p>

						<p>The ABC did not separate CPU and memory, yet it combined binary logic, electronic switching, and automated operations in one system. Data lived on a capacitor drum and results exported to punched cards, influencing later projects such as ENIAC.</p>
