					<p class="event-detail__summary">Babbage imagined a machine that could print accurate tables after long nights correcting mistakes by hand.</p>
				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Working on astronomical tables for the Royal Astronomical Society, Babbage grew frustrated by constant transcription errors. He sketched a device that combined gears and cogs to repeat addition and subtraction. Apprentices at nearby workshops asked, “How can we cut gears this precise?” so Babbage carried brass samples and diagrams between the workshop and his desk, demonstrating each assembly step.</p>
						<p>The prototype never finished, but the idea of breaking calculations into repeated mechanical steps carried forward. It offered a future where machines could deliver the correct values without someone checking every row.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>The Difference Engine applied a mathematical insight: polynomials can be evaluated with addition alone when broken into finite differences. Inputs became the positions of metal rods, and outputs appeared on numbered wheels. Technology of the time could not produce a full-scale machine, yet the notion of delegating repetitive calculations heavily influenced later computer designs.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>While translating Luigi Menabrea’s lecture on Babbage’s Analytical Engine, Lovelace inserted her own extensive annotations. One passage suggested that combining instructions on cards could even make the machine “compose elaborate music,” astonishing her peers. She drew tables that laid out loops and branches—the first documentation of such ideas.</p>
						<p>Babbage replied, “You have explicated possibilities I had not yet detailed.” Her notes reframed the engine as more than a calculator; it could manipulate symbols and patterns.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>In Lovelace’s description, punch cards encoded commands, and the engine separated storage from computation units. Today we recognize that structure as the basis for modern programs. Her observation that the machine might operate on symbols beyond numbers opened the door to viewing computing as a general-purpose medium.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Prompted by his advisor to formalize the notion of procedure, Turing imagined a machine with a read/write head scanning symbols on a tape. A table of state transitions dictated each move. Colleagues recognized that even though the device was abstract, it let them reason about the limits of computation.</p>
						<p>The model helped mathematicians prove the existence of unsolvable problems, such as the Halting Problem, and provided the conceptual bedrock for future computer architectures.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>The Turing Machine separates instructions, states, and inputs in a way that mirrors modern computers. By consuming symbols one at a time, it became the standard language for discussing algorithms, and it remains a fundamental tool for exploring theoretical boundaries.</p>
