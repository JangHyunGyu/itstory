							Charles Babbage wanted a machine to finish the tables that kept him up all night. Wartime crews wired thousands of vacuum tubes just to shave minutes off their calculations.

					<h2 id="event-1822-difference-title">Difference Engine Plans · Charles Babbage</h2>
					<p class="event-detail__summary">Babbage dreamed of a machine that could finish the error-prone tables while everyone else finally got some sleep.</p>
				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>While copying astronomy tables, Babbage kept catching fresh mistakes during midnight proofreads. “If a machine repeated these sums, it would never get bored,” he muttered, sketching gears in his notebook. He walked apprentices through brass prototypes, pointing out how each tooth would tick in a precise order.</p>
						<p>Months later at a Royal Society demo an exhausted astronomer asked, “Does this mean we can stop staying up all night?” Babbage cranked the handle, held up the next printed line, and smiled: “Let the machine grind through the rest.” A factory engineer tucked the plans under his arm, already imagining the design on his own shop floor.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>The Difference Engine split tricky equations into endless chains of addition that gears could repeat without drifting. Operators set numbers with sliding rods and read results from engraved wheels. Even though the full machine never shipped, the belief that “the tedious parts belong to the hardware” stayed with later computer pioneers.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Translating Luigi Menabrea’s lecture, Lovelace stopped mid-sentence and added pages of her own commentary. “Swap the cards and the same engine could compose music,” she suggested, sketching tables that marked loops and branches like a cookbook for logic.</p>
						<p>Babbage wrote back, “You’ve mapped possibilities I never managed to describe.” Over tea Lovelace told friends, “This machine could handle patterns beyond numbers.” Mathematicians across London passed around her notes, amazed that card order alone could shift the engine’s behavior.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>Lovelace argued for punch cards as programmable instructions and insisted the engine separate storage from calculation. Those decisions echo in modern architectures. By hinting that symbols, music, or art could flow through the same machine, she nudged computing beyond strict number crunching.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>During a Cambridge seminar Turing sketched a tape, a tiny read/write head, and a list of rules on the blackboard. “Imagine this head moving left or right, copying the way we follow instructions,” he said, spending late nights turning the idea into precise state tables.</p>
						<p>When classmates asked, “Does this ideal machine solve everything?” Turing unveiled the halting argument: some inputs make the head wander forever. The room fell silent—he had drawn a sharp line between problems machines can and cannot solve.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>The model separates memory (the tape), processing (the head), and instructions (the rule table). Because it mirrors human step-by-step work, it became the reference point for decidable versus undecidable problems. Computer science still leans on this thought experiment to define computation itself.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>On a bitter Iowa night Atanasoff ducked into a café and admitted, “My students are wearing out on these linear systems.” He sketched capacitors glued to a spinning drum for storage, vacuum tubes for arithmetic, and punch cards for output. Graduate assistant Clifford Berry soldered through the night, grinning, “Soon we’ll push a button instead of pulling all-nighters.”</p>
						<p>At the first demo 29 simultaneous equations spilled onto freshly punched cards. “No one touched a slide rule?” a professor asked. Atanasoff held up the warm stack: “The drum remembered every step.” A passing student whispered, “Could it clear our homework next?” and opened the binder to study the plans.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>The ABC stored binary digits on a capacitor-lined drum, switched calculations through vacuum tubes, and logged answers on punch cards. That blend of electronic storage, switching, and automatic output inspired later teams, including the engineers behind ENIAC.</p>

						<p>At the Moore School in Philadelphia, John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert’s crew lined up 18,000 tubes, twisting wires late into the night. Programmer Kay McNulty checked each patch cord and warned, “If we misplace one cable, the answers go sideways.” During the first public firing table demo the machine solved the equations in seconds; the audience burst into applause.</p>
						<p>When a tube popped, McNulty dashed across the hall shouting, “Where’s the spare rack?” An Army officer watched and said, “If you can keep it running, our computation teams might finally catch up.” ENIAC proved that large-scale electronic computing could handle real missions.</p>
