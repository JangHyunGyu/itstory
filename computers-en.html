							Charles Babbage sketched a machine so scientists could finish their tables without staying up all night, and wartime teams piled up vacuum tubes just to get answers a little faster.
							Decades later, engineers asked, “Can I code on something that fits in my pocket?” while other teams suggested, “Let’s rent servers over the Internet when we need them.”

					<p class="event-detail__summary">“What if a machine printed the tables for us without mistakes?” Babbage asked as he filled his notebook with gear sketches late at night.</p>
				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>Babbage was helping astronomers copy tables when he realized the proofreaders kept finding new mistakes. He started visiting metal workshops, telling apprentices, “If these gears turn the same way every time, the numbers will stay right.” When someone asked whether such small teeth were even possible, he placed brass samples on the bench and walked them through the order of each piece.</p>
						<p>At a public demo months later an astronomer asked, “Will this finally end our midnight corrections?” Babbage spun the handle and replied, “Pull this lever and the next line appears on its own.” A factory engineer took notes on the design, already thinking about using the idea back at work.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>The Difference Engine broke tough equations into repeatable additions so the machine could do the routine work. Numbers were set by sliding metal rods, and results showed up on numbered wheels. Even though a full model was never finished, the idea of “let the machine repeat the boring parts” stayed with the next generation of computer builders.</p>

					<p class="event-detail__summary">“Swap the card and the machine can do something else,” Lovelace said, writing down the idea so anyone could follow along.</p>
				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>While translating Luigi Menabrea’s lecture, Lovelace paused and said, “If the cards carry new symbols, the machine could even play music.” A colleague asked, “Wait, not just numbers?” She drew simple tables that showed repeats and if-statements so the plan felt like a recipe anyone could read.</p>
						<p>Babbage wrote back, “You described possibilities I never put on paper.” At tea time Lovelace asked friends, “What if the machine helped with art as well as math?” Mathematicians around London passed the notes along, surprised that changing the cards alone could change the result.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>Lovelace’s notes explained that punch cards could hold commands and that the machine should keep storage and calculation parts separate. That structure looks a lot like modern programs. She also suggested the engine might handle symbols and ideas, not just numbers, which helped people see computing as a flexible medium.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>At the Moore School the team pulled cables in and out while programmer Jean Jennings reminded everyone, “If accumulator three is wrong, all the answers move.” Betty Holberton spread her charts on the console and said, “Check each carry line before we power up.” When the printer produced correct numbers in seconds, the Army visitors said, “Our clerks need a week for that.”</p>
						<p>Vacuum tubes still burned out, and someone yelled “Spare tube!” almost every night, but the crew kept rewiring ENIAC to run new jobs like weather and ballistics. Electronic speed finally outpaced every mechanical calculator they knew.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>ENIAC used accumulators, function tables, and control panels linked by patch cords. Rewiring it by hand took so long that the team began looking for a better way, pushing the stored-program idea that later computers adopted.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="event-detail__body">
					<div class="event-detail__story">
						<p>One snowy night Atanasoff told his colleague Clifford Berry, “They’re falling asleep over these matrices.” Berry replied, “Then let’s store the numbers on a drum and let the machine do it.” They bolted capacitors onto a spinning cylinder, and Berry joked, “Soon you’ll just press a button.”</p>
						<p>When they showed the machine to the faculty, punch cards dropped out with 29 simultaneous answers. “No student touched these rows?” a professor asked. Atanasoff held up the cards and said, “The drum remembered everything.” A graduate student copied the plans, eager to build on the design.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="event-detail__notes">
						<p>The ABC didn’t split the computer into a separate CPU and memory, but it did use binary numbers, electronic switches, and automatic steps in one box. Data lived on a capacitor drum and results went to punched cards. The project encouraged later teams, including the builders of ENIAC.</p>
